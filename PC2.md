##BackStory
Dagon was originally named Righteous by his Tiefling parents. His parents wholeheartedly rejected thier infernal heritage and burden and chose to worship the Gods of light and so called good. Righteous was incredibly curious about his infernal heritage and the answers he was given by his parents and peers were never enough. He loved knowledge and it's pursuit. In it he found comfort. As he grew older he became more and more intrested in his ancient ancestors and their sin. While others saw what his ancestors did as a grave mistake he saw it as a reasonable descision to aquire power and knowledge. That was when he found an ancient tome; a tome that contained a ritual for communing with demons. On one of those star less and moonless nights he went out into the night and performed the ritual, thinking he would be able to learn more about the occult from demons. He did not realize however that the ritual would summon Appollyon one of the Arch Demons. He also misread the text it did not say commune it was to be commissioned. The Demon Appollyon promised a trove of knowledge and occult power for his undying loyalty. In exchange all he would have to do is find more knowledge for the demon since there are things that even the demons of hell don't know. He took the deal, and immediately was given power and knowledge that he had only dreamed of. He was also covered with tattoos all over his body and face so all would know who he served and he was given a new name Dagon. When he returned home; upon seeing his tattoos his parents threw him and he was banished from his hometown. Dagon has spent the past year searching for more arcane knowledge to bring to his master in hopes of more arcane knowledge. He has taken to adventuring in hopes of finding sutibale tribute for his master...
